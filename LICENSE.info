To remove doubt on licensing, its noted that a Cassowary Smalltalk library 
ported by Joshua Gargus is available at http://www.squeaksource.com/Cassowary.html.  
That repo is LGPL licensed.

This repo is MIT Licensed.
It is a separate independent port by Thierry Goubier of the original 12 March 2000 
release https://constraints.cs.washington.edu/cassowary/cassowary-0.60.tar.gz.

Most language implementations included in that archive were licensed LGPL,
but from its included .../smalltalk/README file: 
    This directory contains files for a Smalltalk implementation of Cassowary.  
    This Smalltalk implementation is released to the public domain.
