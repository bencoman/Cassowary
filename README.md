# Cassowary
A Smalltalk Cassowary constraint solver, ported from the original...

https://constraints.cs.washington.edu/cassowary/

Cassowary is an incremental constraint solving toolkit that efficiently
solves systems of linear equalities and inequalities.  Constraints may
be either requirements or preferences.  Client code specifies the
constraints to be maintained, and the solver updates the constrained
variables to have values that satisfy the constraints.

A technical report is included in "docs" folder that describes the
algorithm, interface, and implementation of the Cassowary solver.
